  The plan-then-execute timeline daft renders for worktree create and remove
  commands

# Progress Timeline

On an interactive terminal, the worktree lifecycle commands — `daft go`,
`daft start`, `daft remove` (and their `git-worktree-*` forms), `daft clone`,
and multi-worktree `daft exec` — narrate their work as a plan-then-execute
timeline: the full ordered list of steps renders up front, each step fills in
place as daft works, and the finished rail persists in your scrollback as a
receipt.

## Reading the rail

| Glyph | Meaning                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `○`   | Pending (dim), or an expected skip with its reason                           |
| `⠹`   | The step currently running (spinner)                                         |
| `✓`   | Done — past-tense label, dim duration when the step took ≥ 1s                |
| `✗`   | Failed — the label stays imperative (the fact never happened)                |
| `↓`   | Skipped for an attention-worthy reason (e.g. repo not trusted)               |
| `├─`  | A section anchor (shared files, hook phases, multi-branch remove's branches) |
| `↻`   | A hook job handed to the background coordinator                              |

Rows belonging to a section render tucked inside the rail (`│  ✓  .env`), so the
rail stays a continuous wire and each `├─` anchor visibly carries its children —
in the pending plan, while running, and in the finished receipt. A hook phase
that will open as a section already owns its blank rail lines in the committed
plan, so the plan carries the receipt's rhythm and no row shifts when the
section starts to fill.

Color follows one grammar. State lives in the glyph (green done, bold-red
failed, yellow attention, cyan spinner) and daft's own vocabulary stays plain,
with section headings bold. Subjects wear identity inks that never change with
state — so the committed plan is as readable as the receipt: remote names and
refs (`origin`, `← origin/master`, `→ origin/x`) are cyan, worktree paths are
manila, shared files are violet, and background work is blue. The exceptions are
deliberate: hook job names take their outcome's color (the scheme the standalone
hook renderer's summary also speaks), failure details and skip reasons always
render plain, and a dimmed row — pending glyphs, expected skips, `(not run)` —
never keeps an identity ink.

- The rail opens the moment the command starts (after any pre-flight prompts):
  the header, a grey planning row (`⠹ Validating branches`,
  `⠹ Resolving branch`, `⠹ Cloning repository`), and the ticking stopwatch
  appear immediately, and the committed plan replaces the middle in place as
  soon as the command has resolved its work. The label follows the resolve phase
  — `daft clone` runs its whole network clone under the face, flips to
  `⠹ Resolving branches`, and commits a plan led by the already-done
  `✓ Cloned repository` row. A prompt that must own the terminal mid-resolve
  (the first-clone layout prompt) makes the face step aside tracelessly and
  return once answered. A run that resolves into a navigation early-exit or a
  resolve-phase error collapses the face without a trace and keeps its
  single-line response.
- The header names the resolved intent (`Starting <branch> ← <base>`); the
  footer closes the rail with the outcome and total duration. While the command
  runs, the pending footer is a stopwatch — a dim elapsed counter (`└ 1.2s`)
  ticking from the moment the rail opens until the outcome replaces it.
- With `daft.checkout.fetch` on, the remote fetch is planned work committed
  before the network round-trip: `daft start` opens its rail with the
  `Fetch remote` and `Set up tracking` rows, and `daft go` leads its plan with a
  `Fetch remote` row and notes the branch's provenance (`← origin/x`,
  `tracking origin/x`, `local only`) onto the pending `Check out branch` row
  once the fetch lands. A failed fetch turns its row yellow
  (`↓ Fetch remote  failed — continuing with local refs`) and the command
  proceeds on local refs. A branch the fetch fails to reveal closes `daft go`'s
  rail as a `Failed` receipt with the error below it; with the fetch off, the
  branch probe precedes the plan and an unknown branch keeps the plain error.
  When the morph into branch creation is armed (`daft go --start`, or
  `daft.go.autoStart`), the fetch runs under the planning face instead and the
  plan commits only for a branch that exists — leading with the already-done
  `✓ Fetched remote` row; a missing branch dissolves the face tracelessly and
  `daft start`'s rail is the only rail the run leaves behind. For `daft start`
  the header names the requested base; when the fetch reveals a fresher remote
  ref, the `Created branch` row carries the resolved provenance
  (`← origin/main`).
- The rail lists only work that happens. A step known to be off at planning time
  (push with `daft.checkout.push` off or `--local`) plans no row, and a step
  that resolves as a no-op (carry with a clean tree) removes its row — the
  finished rail is a receipt of what daft actually did. Attention-worthy skips
  are the exception and stay visible.
- Remote indicators appear only while remote interaction is in scope:
  `← origin/x` (created from the remote), `→ origin/x` (pushed),
  `tracking origin/x`, or remove's dim `no remote branch` note when remote
  deletion is on but the branch has no upstream. When configuration takes
  remotes out of scope — `daft config remote-sync` set to local only,
  `daft.branchDelete.remote` off (the default), or `--local` — the rail never
  mentions them, exactly as an unconfigured push plans no row.
- [Shared files](../cli/daft-shared.md) get their own section under a
  `├─ shared files` anchor: one receipt row per declared path stating its state.
  `✓` means the symlink landed; `○ already linked` and `○ materialized` are the
  quiet no-ops; a path never collected into shared storage renders the yellow
  `↓ … missing from shared storage` row with the `daft shared sync` remedy, and
  a real file in the way gets the `daft shared link` remedy. The section never
  silently ignores a declaration it could not honor.
- `daft remove` lists steps in true execution order — the remote branch is
  deleted first (it is the hardest to recreate), then the worktree, then the
  local branch. Multi-branch removals group rows under `├─` branch anchors. Its
  hook rows are planned only when the phase has hooks discoverable at plan time:
  a repository configuring no `worktree-post-remove` hooks plans no
  `post-remove hooks` row at all.
- Lifecycle hooks appear as a plan row framed by its section's rail gaps; when
  they actually run, the row becomes a `├─ post-create hooks` section in place,
  with one receipt row per job. While a job runs, its latest output line rides
  the spinner as a dim annotation — one line of liveness per job. A finished job
  resolves green with the usual dim duration; a failed one turns its row red and
  its captured output prints below the rail footer. Jobs excluded with
  `--skip-hooks` (and jobs skipped because a dependency failed) render yellow
  `↓` rows; jobs skipped by their own `skip:`/`only:` conditions leave no trace,
  and a whole phase skipped that way vanishes with them. Background jobs get a
  blue `↻ name  background` receipt — `daft hooks jobs` manages them from there.
- Pass `-v` — or set `daft.hooks.output.verbose` — to thread each job's log
  under its row. The section anchor gains the hook key and engine version
  (`├─ post-create hooks  worktree-post-create · daft v1.18.1`), and each job's
  output hangs from its glyph column on an inner thread:

  ```
  │  ✓  prepare-db   (2.1s)
  │  │    ❯ ./scripts/prepare-db.sh
  │  │    applying migration 0
  │  │    applying migration 1
  │  │
  │  ✓  bun-install  (2.9s)
  │  │    ❯ bun install
  │  │    resolving package cluster 11
  ```

  The thread opens with the dim `❯ <command>` provenance line, shows a rolling
  window of `daft.hooks.output.tailLines` lines while the job runs, and the
  receipt keeps every line — grey under a job that succeeded, default ink under
  one that failed (evidence stays loud), `(no output)` when it printed nothing.
  Each thread closes with an empty thread line (`│  │`), so consecutive blocks
  keep their own air — live and in the receipt — while the rail's lone `│` stays
  a section boundary. The section closes with its own rail end — a dim
  `└ all jobs in <t>` total — and a job still silent after
  `daft.hooks.output.timerDelay` seconds shows a dim elapsed counter until its
  first output. A failed job's exit status still prints after the footer
  (`error: hook job '<name>' failed (exit code: N)`) — but not its output, which
  already sits inline. When nothing is configured to run, the hook row
  disappears — and `daft remove` goes further: its hook config sources are on
  disk and exact before the plan commits, so the row is never planned. Skips
  worth noticing (untrusted repository, `--skip-hooks all`) render the yellow
  `↓` row instead.

- If a step fails, later steps persist as dim `(not run)` rows and the footer
  reports `Failed after <t>` — the receipt shows exactly how far the command
  got.

## Running commands across worktrees

Multi-worktree `daft exec` renders on the same rail, with one row per targeted
worktree (or, for a `-x` pipeline of several commands, a `├─` group per worktree
with one row per command):

```
┌  Running mise clean in 4 worktrees
│
✓  master                                         (3.2s)
✓  daft-335/feat/visitor-config                   (4.5s)
✗  daft-518/feat/test-runner-output-improvements  exit 1
│    [clean:tests] rm -rf target/tmp
│    error: Permission denied (os error 13)
│
✓  daft-529/exec-show-output                      (12.1s)
│
└  Finished with failures in 12.4s
```

- Workers run concurrently, but the receipt persists in **plan order**: a row
  that finishes early shows its outcome in place immediately and waits, in the
  scrollback, for the rows ahead of it. The header names the resolved scope
  (`in N worktrees`, `in N repos` for `--all-repos`, `in N related worktrees`
  for `--related`); the footer reports `Done in t`,
  `Finished with failures in t` (all ran, some failed), `Failed after t` (a
  `--sequential` run stopped early), or `Cancelled after t`.
- While a worker runs, its latest output line rides its row, dim. A **failed or
  cancelled** worker always threads its full captured output under its row; a
  successful worker stays a compact row. A row cancelled by `Ctrl-C` shows the
  yellow `⊘` face; the `↓` face marks a matched branch with no worktree.
- Pass `-v` (`--verbose`) to thread **every** worker's output — grey under a
  success, a rolling window while it runs — using the same
  `daft.hooks.output.tailLines` window the hook rail uses. A worker's full
  output reaches scrollback only once the rows ahead of it in the plan drain;
  its `✓`/`✗`/`⊘` outcome is never delayed. Nothing prints below the footer. You
  can also press `v` mid-run to switch either way — see [Live keys](#live-keys).
- A **single explicit-target** run (`daft exec feat/auth -- claude`, or a bare
  `--repo`) inherits stdio directly and renders no rail, so interactive programs
  work unchanged. A fan-out — `--all`, a glob, `--all-repos`, `--related`, or
  several positionals — renders the rail even when it resolves to a single live
  worktree (any orphan branches ride along as `↓` rows), rather than collapsing
  to pass-through. When stdout is redirected, `daft exec` still writes its
  captured-output dump there (failures only, or every worker with `-v`) while
  the rail narrates on stderr.

## When the timeline does not render

The timeline is an interactive-terminal presentation. In every other mode daft
prints exactly the output it printed before the timeline existed:

- **Non-interactive stderr** (pipes, CI logs) — plain result lines.
- **`NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`** — plain result lines (the live region requires
  color support; this matches the previous spinner's behavior).
- **`--quiet`** — warnings and errors only.
- **Navigation early-exits** — `daft go` to an existing worktree and `daft go -`
  remain single-line responses; there is no plan to show (the just-opened
  planning face collapses without leaving a trace).
- **Single explicit-target `daft exec`** — inherits stdio directly (so
  interactive programs work); a fan-out or multi-target run on a non-interactive
  stderr prints the same summary rows and output dump it always did.

`daft prune`, `daft repo remove`, and multi-branch `daft clone`'s satellite
phase keep their inline operation table, which already shows all rows up front
and fills them in as work completes. In `daft sync --push`, that table also
surfaces the push resource governor: a push held back under memory pressure
shows a dim `held: memory` (or `held: capped` / `held: frozen` / `held: retry`)
instead of running immediately, and a post-run summary line reports the total
("2 pushes throttled 14s to preserve memory headroom").

## Live keys

While the rail is on screen, the stopwatch footer offers what you can press:

```
└  4.2s   v verbose · ^C cancel
```

**`v` toggles verbose output for the run in progress.** Start terse and press
`v` when a job starts looking interesting, or start with `-v` and press `v` to
quiet it back down — verbosity is a decision you make while watching, not one
you commit to before the run starts.

The toggle takes effect immediately for rows still running and for every receipt
printed from then on. Rows that already finished are a different matter: the
rail is append-only, so their receipts stay exactly where they printed. Turning
verbose on re-emits the logs of finished rows that printed compactly as a
fold-out block below, headed by a repeat of the receipt line:

```
✓  feat/auth
○  verbose on — replaying 1 finished row
✓  feat/auth
│    cargo test --lib
│    test result: ok. 214 passed
│
```

Each log folds out once, so toggling back and forth never repeats it. Failed
rows are not replayed — their output already threaded when they failed. Turning
verbose off collapses the live windows and leaves everything already printed
alone.

The hint and the toggle are terminal-only: with output redirected, in CI, or
under `--quiet` there is no live region, no key listener, and no change to what
daft prints. The toggle also does not change the captured-output dump
`daft exec` writes to a redirected stdout — that follows the `-v` flag you
passed, so a script's output does not depend on what you pressed. Only
`daft exec`'s rows replay; hook-job rows (worktree create/remove, `daft run`)
follow the new density from the next line they print onward.

Pressing `Ctrl-C` mid-run collapses the live remainder of the rail and exits
with status 130; everything already completed stays in your scrollback. A
`daft exec` run interrupts cooperatively instead: the first `Ctrl-C` stops the
running commands (SIGTERM), a second forces them (SIGKILL), and the rail closes
as a `Cancelled` receipt. This is unchanged by the key listener: `Ctrl-C`
reaches daft as a real signal, not as a keystroke.
