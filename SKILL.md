description:
  Guides the daft worktree workflow for compartmentalized Git development. Use
  when working in daft-managed repositories (repos with a .git/ bare directory
  and branch worktrees as sibling directories), when setting up worktree
  environment isolation, or when users ask about worktree-based workflows.
  Covers daft commands, hooks automation via daft.yml, and environment tooling
  like mise, direnv, nvm, and pyenv.

# daft Worktree Workflow

## Core Philosophy

daft treats each Git worktree as a **compartmentalized workspace**, not just a
branch checked out to disk. Each worktree is a fully isolated environment with
its own:

- Working files and Git index
- Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `target/`, `venv/`, `.build/`)
- IDE state and configuration (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Environment files (`.envrc`, `.env`)
- Running processes (dev servers, watchers, test runners)
- Installed dependencies (potentially different versions per branch)

This means creating a new worktree is not just "checking out a branch" -- it is
spinning up a new development environment. Automation (via `daft.yml` hooks)
should install dependencies, configure environment tools, and prepare the
workspace so the developer can start working immediately.

Never use `git checkout` or `git switch` to change branches in a daft-managed
repo. Navigate between worktree directories instead.

## Detecting a daft-managed Repository

A daft-managed repository has this layout:

```
my-project/
+-- .git/                    # Bare repository (shared Git metadata)
+-- main/                    # Worktree for the default branch
|   +-- src/
|   +-- package.json
+-- feature/auth/            # Worktree for a feature branch
|   +-- src/
|   +-- package.json
+-- bugfix/login/            # Worktree for a bugfix branch
```

Key indicators:

- `.git/` at the project root is a **bare repository** (directory, not a file)
- Branch worktrees are **sibling directories** to `.git/`
- Use `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` from any worktree to find the project
  root

If you see this layout, the user is using daft. Apply worktree-aware guidance
throughout the session.

## Invocation Forms

daft commands can be invoked in three ways:

| Form           | Example                               | Requires                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Git subcommand | `git worktree-checkout feature/auth`  | `git-worktree-checkout` symlink on PATH |
| Direct binary  | `daft worktree-checkout feature/auth` | Only the `daft` binary                  |
| Shortcut alias | `gwtco feature/auth`                  | Shortcut symlink on PATH                |

The git subcommand form (`git worktree-*`) is what users type in their terminals
and what documentation references. Shortcuts are optional short aliases managed
via `daft setup shortcuts`.

**Agent execution rule**: When running daft commands, always use the direct
binary form (`daft <subcommand>`). The git subcommand form requires symlinks and
shell wrappers that are not available in most agent shell sandboxes. When
explaining daft usage to users, reference the git subcommand form
(`git worktree-*`) or shortcuts, as these are what users interact with in their
configured terminals.

After creating a worktree with `daft`, the shell does not automatically `cd`
into it (that requires shell wrappers). Navigate to the new worktree using the
layout convention: `cd ../<branch-name>/` relative to any existing worktree.

## Command Reference

All commands below use the `daft` binary form for agent execution. Users know
these as `git` subcommands (e.g., `daft worktree-checkout` is
`git worktree-checkout` to the user).

### Worktree Lifecycle

| Command                                             | Description                                                                      |

| `daft worktree-branch-delete -D <branch>`           | Force-delete a branch bypassing safety checks (except default branch protection) |
| `daft worktree-prune`                               | Remove worktrees whose remote branches have been deleted                         |
| `daft worktree-carry <targets>`                     | Transfer uncommitted changes to one or more other worktrees                      |
| `daft worktree-fetch [targets]`                     | Pull remote updates into worktree branches                                       |

### Adoption and Ejection

| Command                           | Description                                                |

| `daft worktree-flow-adopt [path]` | Convert a traditional repository to daft's worktree layout |
| `daft worktree-flow-eject`        | Convert back to a traditional repository layout            |

### Management

| Command                             | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `daft hooks <subcommand>`           | Manage hooks trust and configuration (`trust`, `deny`, `prompt`, `status`, `list`, `reset-trust`, `migrate`, `install`, `validate`, `dump`) |
| `daft doctor`                       | Diagnose installation and configuration issues; `--fix` auto-repairs symlinks, shortcuts, refspecs, hooks; `--fix --dry-run` previews fixes |

| `daft shell-init <shell>`           | Generate shell integration wrappers                                                                                                         |
| `daft completions <shell>`          | Generate shell tab completions                                                                                                              |

All worktree commands can be run from **any directory** within any worktree.
They find the project root automatically via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.

## Shell Integration

Shell integration is important because the daft binary creates worktrees
internally, but the parent shell stays in the original directory. Shell wrappers
solve this by reading the CD target from a temp file (`DAFT_CD_FILE`) and
running `cd` in the parent shell.

```bash
# Bash / Zsh -- add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
eval "$(daft shell-init bash)"

# Fish -- add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
daft shell-init fish | source

# With short aliases (gwco, gwcob, gwcobd)
eval "$(daft shell-init bash --aliases)"
```

Disable auto-cd per-command with `--no-cd` or globally with
`git config daft.autocd false`.

## Hooks System (daft.yml)

Hooks automate worktree lifecycle events. The recommended approach is a
`daft.yml` file at the repository root.

### Hook Types

| Hook                   | Trigger                       | Runs From                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `post-clone`           | After `daft worktree-clone`   | New default branch worktree |
| `post-init`            | After `daft worktree-init`    | New initial worktree        |
| `worktree-pre-create`  | Before new worktree is added  | Source worktree             |
| `worktree-post-create` | After new worktree is created | New worktree                |
| `worktree-pre-remove`  | Before worktree is removed    | Worktree being removed      |
| `worktree-post-remove` | After worktree is removed     | Current worktree            |

During `daft worktree-clone`, hooks fire in this order: `post-clone` first
(one-time repo bootstrap), then `worktree-post-create` (per-worktree setup).
This lets `post-clone` install foundational tools that `worktree-post-create`
may depend on.

### daft.yml Format

```yaml
min_version: "1.5.0" # Optional: minimum daft version
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    parallel: true # Run jobs concurrently (default)
    jobs:
      - name: install-deps
        run: npm install
      - name: setup-env
        run: cp .env.example .env
```

### Config File Locations (first match wins)

`daft.yml`, `daft.yaml`, `.daft.yml`, `.daft.yaml`, `.config/daft.yml`,
`.config/daft.yaml`

Additionally: `daft-local.yml` for machine-specific overrides (not committed),
and per-hook files like `worktree-post-create.yml`.

### Execution Modes

Set one per hook (default is `parallel`):

| Mode     | Field            | Behavior                          |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Parallel | `parallel: true` | All jobs run concurrently         |
| Piped    | `piped: true`    | Sequential; stop on first failure |
| Follow   | `follow: true`   | Sequential; continue on failure   |

### Job Fields

```yaml
- name: job-name # Display name and dependency reference
  run: "npm install" # Inline command (or use script: "setup.sh")
  runner: "bash" # Interpreter for script files
  root: "frontend" # Working directory relative to worktree
  env: # Extra environment variables
    NODE_ENV: development
  tags: ["build"] # Tags for filtering
  skip: CI # Skip when $CI is set
  only: DEPLOY_ENABLED # Only run when $DEPLOY_ENABLED is set
  needs: [install-npm] # Wait for these jobs to complete first
  interactive: true # Needs TTY (forces sequential)
  priority: 1 # Lower runs first
  fail_text: "Setup failed" # Custom failure message
```

### Job Dependencies

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install-npm
        run: npm install
      - name: install-pip
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: build
        run: npm run build
        needs: [install-npm]
      - name: test
        run: npm test
        needs: [build, install-pip]
```

Independent jobs (`install-npm`, `install-pip`) run in parallel. Dependent jobs
wait for their dependencies.

### Groups

A job can contain a nested group with its own execution mode:

```yaml
- name: checks
  group:
    parallel: true
    jobs:
      - name: lint
        run: cargo clippy
      - name: format
        run: cargo fmt --check
```

### Template Variables

Available in `run` commands:

| Variable            | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `{branch}`          | Target branch name                         |
| `{worktree_path}`   | Path to the target worktree                |
| `{worktree_root}`   | Project root directory                     |
| `{source_worktree}` | Path to the source worktree                |
| `{git_dir}`         | Path to the `.git` directory               |
| `{remote}`          | Remote name (usually `origin`)             |
| `{job_name}`        | Name of the current job                    |
| `{base_branch}`     | Base branch (for checkout-branch commands) |
| `{repository_url}`  | Repository URL (for post-clone)            |
| `{default_branch}`  | Default branch name (for post-clone)       |

### Skip and Only Conditions

```yaml
skip: CI                         # Skip when env var is truthy
skip: true                       # Always skip
skip:
  - merge                        # Skip during merge
  - rebase                       # Skip during rebase
  - ref: "release/*"             # Skip if branch matches glob
  - env: SKIP_HOOKS              # Skip if env var is truthy
  - run: "test -f .skip-hooks"   # Skip if command exits 0

only:
  - env: DEPLOY_ENABLED          # Only run when env var is set
  - ref: "main"                  # Only run on main branch
```

### Trust Management

Hooks from untrusted repos do not run automatically. Manage trust with:

```bash
daft hooks trust        # Allow hooks to run
daft hooks prompt       # Prompt before each execution
daft hooks deny         # Never run hooks (default)
daft hooks status       # Check current trust level
daft hooks install      # Scaffold a daft.yml with placeholders
daft hooks validate     # Validate configuration syntax
daft hooks dump         # Show fully merged configuration
```

### Environment Variables in Hooks

All hooks receive: `DAFT_HOOK`, `DAFT_COMMAND`, `DAFT_PROJECT_ROOT`,
`DAFT_GIT_DIR`, `DAFT_REMOTE`, `DAFT_SOURCE_WORKTREE`.

Worktree hooks add: `DAFT_WORKTREE_PATH`, `DAFT_BRANCH_NAME`.

Creation hooks add: `DAFT_IS_NEW_BRANCH`, `DAFT_BASE_BRANCH`.

Clone hooks add: `DAFT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `DAFT_DEFAULT_BRANCH`.

Removal hooks add: `DAFT_REMOVAL_REASON` (`remote-deleted`, `manual`, or
`ejecting`).

## Environment Tool Detection and Setup

When working in a daft repo, detect environment tools by their marker files and
suggest `daft.yml` hooks to automate setup for new worktrees.

### Tool Detection Table

| Tool       | Marker Files                                      | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

### Hook Jobs for Detected Tools

**mise** (if `.mise.toml` or `.tool-versions` exists):

```yaml
- name: mise-install
  run: mise install
```

**direnv** (if `.envrc` exists):

```yaml
- name: direnv-allow
  run: direnv allow .
```

**nvm** (if `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` exists):

```yaml
- name: nvm-use
  run: |
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    nvm install
```

**npm** (if `package.json` exists):

```yaml
- name: npm-install
  run: npm install
```

**pip with venv** (if `requirements.txt` exists):

```yaml
- name: pip-install
  run: |
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Cargo** (if `Cargo.toml` exists):

```yaml
- name: cargo-build
  run: cargo build
```

### Comprehensive Example

For a project using mise, direnv, and npm:

```yaml
hooks:
  post-clone:
    piped: true
    jobs:
      - name: mise-install
        run: mise install
      - name: direnv-allow
        run: direnv allow .
      - name: npm-install
        run: npm install
        needs: [mise-install]
      - name: setup-env
        run: cp .env.example .env

  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: mise-install
        run: mise install
      - name: direnv-allow
        run: direnv allow .
      - name: npm-install
        run: npm install
        needs: [mise-install]
```

## Suggesting Tooling for Repos That Lack It

When a daft-managed repo has no `daft.yml`, check for dependency files and
suggest creating one. A `worktree-post-create` hook that installs dependencies
is the most impactful automation to add.

### Starter Configurations

**Node.js project** (detected via `package.json`):

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install-deps
        run: npm install
```

**Python project** (detected via `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`):

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install-deps
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          . .venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Rust project** (detected via `Cargo.toml`):

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: build
        run: cargo build
```

**Go project** (detected via `go.mod`):

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: download-deps
        run: go mod download
```

When suggesting `daft.yml`, also remind the user to trust the repo:
`daft hooks trust`.

## Workflow Guidance for Agents

When working in a daft-managed repository, apply these translations:

| User intent           | Correct daft approach                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Create a branch"     | `daft worktree-checkout-branch <name>` -- creates branch + worktree + pushes                         |
| "Branch from main"    | `daft worktree-checkout-branch <name> main` -- branches from the specified base                      |
| "Switch to branch X"  | Navigate to the worktree directory: `cd ../X/`                                                       |
| "Check out a PR"      | `daft worktree-checkout <branch>` -- creates worktree for existing branch                            |
| "Delete a branch"     | `daft worktree-branch-delete <branch>` -- removes worktree, local branch, and remote tracking branch |
| "Clean up branches"   | `daft worktree-prune` -- removes worktrees for deleted remote branches                               |
| "Wrong branch"        | `daft worktree-carry <correct-branch>` -- moves uncommitted changes                                  |
| "Update from remote"  | `daft worktree-fetch` -- pulls updates into current or specified worktrees                           |
| "Adopt existing repo" | `daft worktree-flow-adopt` -- converts traditional repo to daft layout                               |

### Per-worktree Isolation

Each worktree has its **own** `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, etc. When a
new worktree is created without `daft.yml` hooks, dependencies are not installed
automatically. If the user creates a new worktree and encounters
missing-dependency errors, the fix is to run the appropriate install command in
that worktree (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### Navigating Worktrees

From any worktree, sibling worktrees are at `../<branch-name>/`. The project
root (containing `.git/`) is at `..` relative to any top-level worktree. Use
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to programmatically find the root.

### Modifying Shared Files

Files like `daft.yml`, `.gitignore`, and CI configuration live in each worktree
independently (they are part of the Git-tracked content). Changes to these files
in one worktree must be committed and merged to propagate to other worktrees.

## Shortcuts

daft supports three shortcut styles as symlink aliases for faster terminal use:

| Style         | Shortcuts                                                                            | Example              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Git (default) | `gwtclone`, `gwtinit`, `gwtco`, `gwtcb`, `gwtbd`, `gwtprune`, `gwtcarry`, `gwtfetch` | `gwtco feature/auth` |
| Shell         | `gwco`, `gwcob`                                                                      | `gwco feature/auth`  |
| Legacy        | `gclone`, `gcw`, `gcbw`, `gprune`                                                    | `gcw feature/auth`   |

Default-branch shortcuts (`gwtcm`, `gwtcbm`, `gwcobd`, `gcbdw`) are available
via shell integration only (`daft shell-init`). They resolve the remote's
default branch dynamically.

Manage with `daft setup shortcuts list`, `enable <style>`, `disable <style>`,
`only <style>`.

When a user asks how to use daft more efficiently, mention shortcuts as a
convenience option. Agents should never execute shortcuts directly -- always use
the `daft` binary form (see [Invocation Forms](#invocation-forms)).
