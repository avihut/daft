.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Lists all worktrees in the current project with enriched status information
including uncommitted changes, ahead/behind counts vs. both the base branch
and the remote tracking branch, branch age, and last commit details.

Each worktree is shown with:
  \- A `>` marker for the current worktree
  \- Branch name, with `*` for the default branch (like git branch)
  \- Relative path from the current directory
  \- Ahead/behind counts vs. the base branch (e.g. +3 \-1)
  \- Count of uncommitted/untracked files (e.g. ~3)
  \- Ahead/behind counts vs. remote tracking branch (e.g. +1 \-2)
  \- Branch age since creation (e.g. 3d, 2w, 5mo)
  \- Last commit: shorthand age + subject (e.g. 1h fix login bug)

Ages use shorthand notation: <1m, Xm, Xh, Xd, Xw, Xmo, Xy.
