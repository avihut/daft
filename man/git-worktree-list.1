Each worktree is shown with:
  \- A `>` marker for the current worktree
  \- Branch name (or "(detached)" for detached HEAD)
  \- Relative path from the current directory
  \- Short HEAD commit SHA
  \- Ahead/behind counts vs. the base branch (e.g. +3 \-1)

  \- Remote tracking branch (e.g. origin/main)
  \- Branch age since creation (e.g. 3d, 2w, 5mo)
  \- Last commit: shorthand age + subject (e.g. 1h fix login bug)
