.SH NAME
git\-worktree\-checkout\-branch\-from\-default \- Create a worktree with a new branch based on the remote\*(Aqs default branch
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgit\-worktree\-checkout\-branch\-from\-default\fR [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-\-carry\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-carry\fR] [\fB\-r\fR|\fB\-\-remote\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] <\fINEW_BRANCH_NAME\fR> 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a new branch based on the remote\*(Aqs default branch (typically main or
master) and a corresponding worktree. This is equivalent to running
git\-worktree\-checkout\-branch(1) with the default branch as the base.
.PP
The default branch is determined by querying the remote\*(Aqs HEAD reference.
This command is useful when the current branch has diverged from the mainline
and a fresh starting point is needed.
.PP
By default, uncommitted changes from the current worktree are carried to the
new worktree; use \-\-no\-carry to disable this. The worktree is placed at the
project root level as a sibling to other worktrees.
