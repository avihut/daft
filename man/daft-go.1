.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Opens a worktree for an existing local or remote branch. The worktree is
placed at the project root level as a sibling to other worktrees, using the
branch name as the directory name.
.PP
If the branch exists only on the remote, a local tracking branch is created
automatically. If the branch exists both locally and on the remote, the local
branch is checked out and upstream tracking is configured.
.PP
If a worktree for the specified branch already exists, no new worktree is
created; the working directory is changed to the existing worktree instead.
.PP
Use \*(Aq\-\*(Aq as the branch name to switch to the previous worktree, similar to
\*(Aqcd \-\*(Aq. Repeated \*(Aqdaft go \-\*(Aq toggles between the two most recent worktrees.
.PP
With \-b, creates a new branch and worktree in a single operation. The new
branch is based on the current branch, or on <base\-branch> if specified.
Prefer \*(Aqdaft start\*(Aq for creating new branches.
.PP
With \-s (\-\-start), if the specified branch does not exist locally or on the
remote, a new branch and worktree are created automatically. This can also
be enabled permanently with the daft.go.autoStart git config option.
.PP
Lifecycle hooks from .daft/hooks/ are executed if the repository is trusted.
See daft\-hooks(1) for hook management.
