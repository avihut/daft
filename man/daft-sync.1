.SH NAME
daft\-sync \- Synchronize worktrees with remote (prune + update all)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdaft\-sync\fR [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-f\fR|\fB\-\-force\fR] [\fB\-\-rebase\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Synchronizes all worktrees with the remote in a single command.
.PP
This is equivalent to running `daft prune` followed by `daft update \-\-all`:
.PP
  1. Prune: fetches with \-\-prune, removes worktrees and branches for deleted
     remote branches, executes lifecycle hooks for each removal.
  2. Update: pulls all remaining worktrees from their remote tracking branches.
  3. Rebase (\-\-rebase BRANCH): rebases all remaining worktrees onto BRANCH.
     Best\-effort: conflicts are immediately aborted and reported.
.PP
If you are currently inside a worktree that gets pruned, the shell is redirected
to a safe location (project root by default, or as configured via
daft.prune.cdTarget).
.PP
For fine\-grained control over either phase, use `daft prune` and `daft update`
separately.
