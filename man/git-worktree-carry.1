.SH NAME
git\-worktree\-carry \- Transfer uncommitted changes to other worktrees
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgit\-worktree\-carry\fR [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-\-copy\fR] [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] <\fITARGETS\fR> 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Transfers uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked files) from
the current worktree to one or more target worktrees.
.PP
When a single target is specified without \-\-copy, changes are moved: they
are applied to the target worktree and removed from the source. When \-\-copy
is specified or multiple targets are given, changes are copied: they are
applied to all targets while remaining in the source worktree.
.PP
Targets may be specified by worktree directory name or by branch name. If
both a worktree and a branch have the same name, the worktree takes
precedence.
.PP
After transferring changes, the working directory is changed to the last
target worktree (or the only target, if just one was specified).
