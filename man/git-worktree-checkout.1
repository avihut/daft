.SH NAME
git\-worktree\-checkout \- Create a worktree for an existing branch, or a new branch with \-b
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgit\-worktree\-checkout\fR [\fB\-b\fR|\fB\-\-create\-branch\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-\-carry\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-carry\fR] [\fB\-r\fR|\fB\-\-remote\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-cd\fR] [\fB\-x\fR|\fB\-\-exec\fR] [\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-\-start\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] <\fIBRANCH_NAME\fR> [\fIBASE_BRANCH_NAME\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a new worktree for an existing local or remote branch. The worktree
is placed at the project root level as a sibling to other worktrees, using
the branch name as the directory name.
.PP
If the branch exists only on the remote, a local tracking branch is created
automatically. If the branch exists both locally and on the remote, the local
branch is checked out and upstream tracking is configured.
.PP
With \-b, creates a new branch and a corresponding worktree in a single
operation. The new branch is based on the current branch, or on <base\-branch>
if specified. After creating the branch locally, it is pushed to the remote
and upstream tracking is configured.
.PP
This command can be run from anywhere within the repository. If a worktree
for the specified branch already exists, no new worktree is created; the
working directory is changed to the existing worktree instead.
.PP
Lifecycle hooks from .daft/hooks/ are executed if the repository is trusted.
See git\-daft(1) for hook management.
