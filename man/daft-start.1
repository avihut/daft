.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a new branch and a corresponding worktree in a single operation. The
worktree is placed at the project root level as a sibling to other worktrees,
using the branch name as the directory name.
.PP
The new branch is based on the current branch, or on <base\-branch> if
specified. After creating the branch locally, it is pushed to the remote and
upstream tracking is configured (unless disabled via daft.checkoutBranch.push).
.PP
This command can be run from anywhere within the repository.
.PP
Lifecycle hooks from .daft/hooks/ are executed if the repository is trusted.
See daft\-hooks(1) for hook management.
