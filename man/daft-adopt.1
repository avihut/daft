.SH NAME
daft\-adopt \- Convert a traditional repository to worktree\-based layout
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdaft\-adopt\fR [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-\-trust\-hooks\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-hooks\fR] [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fIREPOSITORY_PATH\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES
.PP
Converts your existing Git repository from the traditional layout to daft\*(Aqs
worktree\-based layout. After conversion:
.PP
  Before:                    After:
  my\-project/                my\-project/
  ├── .git/                  ├── .git/        (bare repository)
  ├── src/                   └── main/        (worktree)
  └── README.md                  ├── src/
                                 └── README.md
.PP
Your uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) are preserved in the new
worktree. The command is safe to run \- if anything fails, your repository
is restored to its original state.
.PP
ABOUT THE WORKTREE WORKFLOW
.PP
The worktree workflow eliminates Git branch switching friction by giving
each branch its own directory. Instead of switching branches within a
single directory, you navigate between directories \- each containing
a different branch.
.PP
BENEFITS
.PP
\- No more stashing: Each branch has its own working directory
\- Parallel development: Work on multiple branches simultaneously
\- Persistent context: Each worktree keeps its own IDE state, terminal
  history, and environment (.envrc, node_modules, etc.)
\- Instant switching: Just cd to another directory
\- Safe experimentation: Changes in one worktree never affect another
.PP
HOW TO WORK WITH IT
.PP
After adopting, use these commands:
.PP
  daft go <branch>
      Check out an existing branch into a new worktree
.PP
  daft start <new\-branch>
      Create a new branch and worktree from current branch
.PP
  daft start <new\-branch> main
      Create a new branch from a specific base branch
.PP
  daft prune
      Clean up worktrees for merged/deleted branches
.PP
Your directory structure grows as you work:
.PP
  my\-project/
  ├── .git/
  ├── main/              # Default branch
  ├── feature/auth/      # Feature branch
  └── bugfix/login/      # Bugfix branch
.PP
