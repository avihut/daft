.SH NAME
git\-worktree\-prune \- Remove worktrees and branches for deleted remote branches
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgit\-worktree\-prune\fR [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Removes local branches whose corresponding remote tracking branches have been
deleted, along with any associated worktrees. This is useful for cleaning up
after branches have been merged and deleted on the remote.
.PP
The command first fetches from the remote with pruning enabled to update the
list of remote tracking branches. It then identifies local branches that were
tracking now\-deleted remote branches, removes their worktrees (if any exist),
and finally deletes the local branches.
.PP
Pre\-remove and post\-remove lifecycle hooks are executed for each worktree
removal if the repository is trusted. See git\-daft(1) for hook management.
